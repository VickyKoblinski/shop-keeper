/** Vuex - Modules
 * 
 * Due to using a single state tree, all state of our application 
 * is contained inside one big object. However, as our application 
 * grows in scale, the store can get really bloated.
 * 
 * To help with that, Vuex allows us to divide our store into modules. 
 * Each module can contain its own state, mutations, actions, getters, 
 * and even nested modules - it's fractal all the way down.
