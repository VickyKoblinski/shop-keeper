/** Vuex - State
 * 
 * Vuex uses a single state tree - that is, this single object 
 * contains all your application level state and serves as the 
 * "single source of truth". This also means usually you will have 
 * only one store for each application. A single state tree makes 
 * it straightforward to locate a specific piece of state, and 
 * allows us to easily take snapshots of the current app state 
 * for debugging purposes.
 * https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/state.html
 */
const state = {
  items: []
};

/** Vuex - Getters
 * 
 * Computed properties for stores. Like computed properties, 
 * a getter's result is cached based on its dependencies, 
 * and will only re-evaluate when some of its dependencies have 
 * changed.
 * https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/getters.html
 */
const getters = {
  items: state => state.items
};

/** Vuex - Mutations
 * 
 * The only way to actually change state in a Vuex store is by 
 * committing a mutation. Vuex mutations are very similar to events: 
 * each mutation has a string type and a handler. The handler 
 * function is where we perform actual state modifications, and 
 * it will receive the state as the first argumen
 * https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/mutations.html

  SET_ITEMS(state, items) {
    state.items = items;
  },
  RND_ITEMS(state) {
    //TODO: Randomize item data at end of day
  }
};

/** Vuex - Actions
 * 
 * Actions are similar to mutations, the differences being that:
   - Instead of mutating the state, actions commit mutations.
   - Actions can contain arbitrary asynchronous operations.
 * https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/actions.html
